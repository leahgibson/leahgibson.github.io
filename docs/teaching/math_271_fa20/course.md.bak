# Math 271 Fall 2020

### Series and limits, Taylor series, complex variables, first- and second- order ordinary differential equations, matrices, linear transformations, determinants, and eigenvalues.

I am currently teaching the Math 271/272 sequence at Colorado State University. 
This semester was heavily affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. 
In order to prevent further spread of the virus, I chose to run this course in an online format.
After all was said and done, student learning did not seem to be diminished. 

## Project
The project for this class was designed to be an exploration of quantum entanglement. 
The students had covered a wealth of linear algebra and this was a means of including some multilinear algebra as well.
Fortunately, it tied back into the quantum mechanics they had already learned from this course!

## Exams

Exams were done partially as take home and partially in class during a 50 minute session with webcams on. 
This did not seem to be the best way to conduct exams in an online format and this prompted changes for the following semesters.
