I am currently teaching the Math 271/272 sequence at Colorado State University. The materials below were created by myself for Math 271. Each semester I make changes to the course in an attempt to improve the class structure. 
This semester we will forgo quizzes entirely and favor in class participation activities.
Similarly to the end of fall 2021, we will also concentrate more on homework and collaboration. 
These changes were suggested by students who took 271 in the fall.
