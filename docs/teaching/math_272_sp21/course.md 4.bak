# Math 272 Spring 2021

### Vector fields, partial differentiation, cylindrical and spherical coordinates, multiple integrals, line integrals, the Wave and the Schrödinger equations, separation of variables method. Inner Product Spaces. Fourier Series.

I am currently teaching the Math 271/272 sequence at Colorado State University. 
This semester was taught completely online just like the fall 2020 semester for 271.
The class had oral exams done virtually and I met with each student one-on-one.

## Project
The project for this class was to find analytical solutions to the Schrödinger equation for a central Coloumb potential.
In other words, we found explicit states for electrons in a hydrogen atom.

## Homework Assignments

This semester I decided to concentrate more on homework assignments rather than quizzes and exams. I felt it gave the students more room to learn and collaborate.

## Exams

Exams were done as take home exams with an oral component. I met with each student individually to ask for clarification on their solutions. I also asked questions about the content that they did not know before hand.
