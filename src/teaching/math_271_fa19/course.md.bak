# Math 271 Fall 2019

### Series and limits, Taylor series, complex variables, first- and second- order ordinary differential equations, matrices, linear transformations, determinants, and eigenvalues.

I am currently teaching the Math 271/272 sequence at Colorado State University. 
This was the first semester teaching this sequence course.

## Project
The project for this class was designed to be an exploration of the Fourier series as it arises via solutions to physical problems.
It was meant to motivate the content of the sequel, Math 272.
