# Math 272 Spring 2020

### Vector fields, partial differentiation, cylindrical and spherical coordinates, multiple integrals, line integrals, the Wave and the Schrödinger equations, separation of variables method. Inner Product Spaces. Fourier Series.

I am currently teaching the Math 271/272 sequence at Colorado State University. 
This semester marked the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic. 
Classes were greatly affected by the switch to an online format. 
Changes were made to the syllabus in order to accomodate students.

## Project
The project for this class was to find analytical solutions to the Schrödinger equation for a central Coloumb potential.
In other words, we found explicit states for electrons in a hydrogen atom.
