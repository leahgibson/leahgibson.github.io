As a mathematician, I am interested in physical problems and geometry.  In my mind, the linkage between these two components is through partial differential equations (PDEs). PDEs are typically studied in an analytical sense with boundary value problems posed on subregions in n-dimensional Eucliean space.  However, the coordinate free perspective granted by Riemannian geometry may provide new insights or techniques to make progress in both old and new problems.
