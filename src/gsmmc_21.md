# GSMMC2021

The Graduate Student Mathematical Modeling Camp (GSMMC) is a week long workshop where graduate students from a variety of STEM fields work together on a given mathematical modeling project. In the week, students further reserach on the given project, write a paper summarizing their work, and present their work to everyone at the workshop.

I completed a project modeling water flow within plants. Plants are a link between the land and the atmosphere. They thus play an important role in an Earth System Model which models the complex insteractions between the differert systems on Earth (oceans, ice, land, atmosphere, etc.). During this week of reserach, I worked with a subgroup where we focused on expaning the basic bulk plant hydraulics model which models the flow of water through a plant with only one leaf, such as a single blade of graph.  

Besides learning a fair bit of plant biology in the process of modeling water flow, I also further developed my collaboration skills, reserach abilities, and my ability to work quickly and efficently.
