### I am a Ph.D. candidate at Colorado State University. My areas of interest are in Riemannian geometry, Clifford analysis, mathematical physics, and partial differential equations.


Here is a copy of my [CV](files/documents/cv.pdf) and my [resume](files/documents/resume.pdf).

Block math test \\[\sum_{n=0}^\infty \frac{f^{(n)}(x_0)}{n!}(x-x_0)\\]

Inline math test \\( H^k_{\textrm{dR}}(M) \cong H_k^{\textrm{dR}}(M,\partial M) \\)

Code test 
```
for i = 1 to K
	sum = sum + i;
end
```
