### I am a mathematics graduate student at Colorado State University. My areas of interest are PDE's, mathematical modeling, and environmental focused mathematics. When I'm not doing math, I enjoy running, hiking, backpacking, and photographing all of the beautiful places I visit!


Here is a copy of my [CV](files/documents/Official_CV.pdf).
