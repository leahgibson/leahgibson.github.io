# Teaching

Colorado State University (CSU) provides their graduate students with the unique ability to teach classes.  I have been fortunate enough to have experience teaching a variety of courses at CSU which has not only helped me strengthen my mathematical knowledge but my ability to speak share my knowledge in a public forum.  Moreso, I believe that teaching is a fundamental skill for mathematicians and physicists alike.

I put a large effort into providing a great learning experience for my students. Starting in the spring of 2019, I was given courses in which there is only a single section and was left to coordinating the courses myself with some oversight from the department.  This allowed me to develop personalized content for these classes (Math 255, 271, and 272) which can hopefully be used for years to come.
